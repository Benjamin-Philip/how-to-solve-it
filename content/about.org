* The Problem at Hand

I recently started reading "How to Solve It" by Polya, joining the many
generations of mathematicians to do so before me. Like the vast majority of
those who have read this book, I'm reading it as a student. Unlike the vast
majority, I'm a highschool student.

Being an Indian, with an ambition to study Computer Science, I joined the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination][JEE]]
rat race about 7 months ago. Over the months, I've come to neglect the subject
which was once my pride and joy - Maths. To make matters worse, I've gone with
[[https://srichaitanya.net/c-120-program/][Chait]] which is teaching Maths in the strangest order I've ever seen. They
started with Advanced Trigonometry, without even doing functions.

In classic trig style, the problems were very abstract. A common question was
something on the lines of if $\tan \theta = ...$ then find $\sin \frac{\theta}{2} + ...$.
The answer typically came from applying the formula we just learnt, but in some
twisted way which I can't fathom anyone thinking of. Additionally I had another
problem: the "formulae" were just given to me, without any insight from where it
came.

I, being the idiot who derived all (well most) of his tools from the basics,
even during exams, wanted to also know the derivation for all the formulae I
used. I quenched that thirst by reading [[https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Algebra_and_Trigonometry.html?id=uJqaBAAAQBAJ][Algebra and Trigonometry]] by Stewart,
Redlin and Watson. It definitely helped make the identities a lot more useful.
Yet, despite my new found insight, I was unable to solve the problems in the
exams.

I couldn't tell /why/ we were doing a particular, step. Unlike many Physics,
Geometry, and other practical problems, there wasn't any deductive, systematic
way of going about the question. It was very similar to my initial struggles
with quadratic algebra. We just did steps that you /felt/ were in the right
direction. And if by bad luck your gut feel was wrong, you've just lost some
part of your life for nothing. Repeat the same struggles for Algebra, Calculus,
and Linear Algebra for few months, and I had given up on Maths all together.

I was very, very good at applying maths in a problem with concrete relations,
puzzles which were very easy to intuit the solution to. But I was very weak at
this sort gut-feel, no system, Maths. Strong at the /science/ of it, but weak at
the /art/.

Reading "How to Solve It" is my attempt to correct this wrong, and my neglect of
Maths.

* What I am going to do

Since I am almost certainly going to forget a good part of what I read, I
thought it would be a good idea to make notes of what I read. To get gist of
things so that when I want to refer something in the future, I can easily find
the relevant bit and re-read if necessary.

It also then occurred to me to publish these notes in case someone else finds
them useful. Maybe publish them will come in use to me.

I am going to split these notes according to part, and splitting each part if
necessary. I'll try to make a short summary of whatever is important, and stay
as concise and to the point as possible.
